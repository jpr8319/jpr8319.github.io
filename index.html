<h1>
Hello Class! My name is Jeff Ramon. I am seeking a MS in Learning Design and Technology from USF. 
I have three years of experience as a freelance technical writer, video producer, and instructional designer. 
I don't have much time for hobbies but in my free time I enjoy exercising, watching TV, and photography. 
Back when I had more free time, I was learning to play the guitar and salsa dance.

<h2>I am going to include some of my projects from school on this page. I'll add to this section as the semester progresses.</h2>
