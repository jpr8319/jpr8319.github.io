<p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Jeff Ramon. I am seeking a MS in Learning Design and Technology from USF. 
I have three years of experience as a freelance technical writer, video producer, and instructional designer. 
</p>
<p>
I also have a portfolio of instructional design work. You can check that out <a href="https://www.jefframonportfolio.com" target="_blank"> here </a>if you like.    
</p>
<p>
I don't have much time for hobbies but in my free time I enjoy exercising, watching TV, and photography. 
Back when I had more free time, I was learning to play the guitar and salsa dance.</p>
</p>
<p> 
This page contains my projects for school. Click the links below to see some of what I have learned.     
</p>
<p>
If I have not put homework for that week up yet, I have just included a link to the W3Schools website as a placeholder, and to test my code.
